			<h2>US economy grows faster than expected in third quarter</h2>
			<p class="description">The US economy expanded at an annual pace of 3% during the three months to the end of September, which was stronger than expected.</p>
			<p>The Competition and Markets Authority is concerned that rather than helping consumers, the sites might actually be making it more difficult for them.</p>
			<p>The CMA said it was "concerned about the clarity, accuracy and presentation of information on sites".</p>
			<p>The investigation will examine areas such as hidden charges, search results, and discount claims.</p>
			<p>Leading booking sites include Expedia and Booking.com.</p>
			<p>In a statement, booking site Trivago, which is majority owned by Expedia, said: "Trivago will work with the CMA to explain the benefits it delivers to consumers looking for their ideal hotel."</p>
			<p>Booking.com said it would not be commenting at this time.</p>
			<p>According to the CMA, about 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites.</p>
			<p>Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, told the BBC's Today programme: "We are concerned about the clarity and accuracy of these sites. Rather than helping consumers they may actually be making it more difficult for them."</p>
